      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Traditional&amp;rdquo; way to manage servers was to RDP or SSH into them and apply the changes you needed to do. And this was regarded as safe to do (Not by everyone of course) since you usually already were inside the office or datacenter.

You can just open up RDP for your IP-address or a whole range of IP-addresses, but it is not recommended.</description>
