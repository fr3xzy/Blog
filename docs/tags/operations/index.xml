      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my previous blog by introducing Azure Run Command as a feature to run Powershell and Bash scripts on VMs straight from the Azure Portal. In this blog I&amp;rsquo;m gonna dive deeper into the feature and show a real life example of how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-two-versions-of-run-command&#34;&gt;The two versions of Run Command&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention in my last blog is that there are actually two different versions of Run Command. They are action Run Command and Managed Run Command. Action Run Command is the most known version. This is also the feature that you have in the menu for VMs in Azure:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Traditional&amp;rdquo; way to manage servers was to RDP or SSH into them and apply the changes you needed to do. And this was regarded as safe to do (Not by everyone of course) since you usually already were inside the office or datacenter. But when your servers are in another datacenter or even on the other side of the world, what can you do then?&#xA;You can just open up RDP for your IP-address or a whole range of IP-addresses, but it is not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
