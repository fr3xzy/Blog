      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even on the North Pole they must adopt new technologies, and Santa has started using Bicep to deploy his list of this year&amp;rsquo;s presents. Last year, Santa got a huge fine from the North pole Data Protection Authority after he committed the full naughty list into source control in a public repository. This year, Santa needs help with securing his secrets in Bicep templates during deployments!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I start the blogpost, I want to give a shoutout to the organizers of the Festive Tech Calendar for the amazing work they do! This year&amp;rsquo;s Festive Tech Calendar are raising money for the charity &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Missing people&lt;/a&gt;. A charity that helps find and reconnect missing persons with their loved ones. If you want to help in the fundraising, you can go to this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/festivetechcalendar2022&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and donate. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Run scripts on VMs after deployment with Bicep</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bicep is an IaC-language which is created by Microsoft for Azure. Therefore, it does not have capabilities to do configuration management of Virtual machines directly. There are however ways to do some level of desired state configuration (DSC) on OS-level of Virtual machines using another Azure service. This service is Run Commands! &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; that there is other services like &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/nb-no/azure/automation/automation-dsc-overview&#34;&gt;Azure Automation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/nb-no/azure/automanage/automanage-virtual-machines#participating-services&#34;&gt;Azure Automanage&lt;/a&gt; that do DSC, but this blogpost is about Run Commands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The SQL Server AllowAllAzureIps setting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a longer one. You have been warned!&#xA;This adventure started last week when I attended the Azure User Group Norway with a session on Azure SQL networking secrets by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Dennes&#34;&gt;Dennes Torres&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dennes showed a setting in the firewall rules on Azure SQL server that said, &amp;ldquo;Allow Azure services and resources to access this server&amp;rdquo;. Now you might think &amp;ldquo;Yeah, I need that for my App Service to access the database&amp;rdquo;, but in reality, this setting will allow &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; Azure IPs to access the SQL server! Both me and the other attendees at the session was in shock and thought &amp;ldquo;How do I prevent this from being turned on?&amp;rdquo;. This got me diving down the rabbit hole of firewall rules on Azure SQL server and how this setting worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deploy Azure Firewall ruleset for Azure AD with Bicep</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who have used the portal to add rules to Azure Firewall will know how tedious and annoying it can get. With small fields to write both destination and source, it does get old very quick. And something that I found myself doing for several customers was setting the rules required for Azure AD Connect. I quickly got tired of doing it manually, so I created a Bicep template to deploy it much easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
